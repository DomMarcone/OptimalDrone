This software is to look for a parts.xml file, which should contain a list of parts which are attainable to the user. It will parse the file into a part structure, then build every possible permutation of parts.

Each permutation will be tested under various metrics, such as estimated flight time, carrying capacity, acceleration, or any other test which can be calculated from part specifications.

PartInterface (class)
-Each part can contain various sub-parts. This should account for individual parts as well as kits, and composite parts such as camera+transmitter combos, and pdb's which are built into the flight controller.

-It's attributes will contain name, cost, type_flags, and potentially a list of subparts
