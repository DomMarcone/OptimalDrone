# OptimalDrone
A backtracker and tester for drone part combinations.

The idea came after wanting to not only build a drone, but pick the most optimal selection of parts to achieve a dynamic set of design goals.

At it's core, it's a backtracking algorithm, which will generate every possible permutation of parts. After a complete permutation is generated, it's validated, tested, and will (hopefully soon) be ranked.
